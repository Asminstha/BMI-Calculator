# BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built using React.js. It allows users to calculate their BMI by inputting their weight and height. Based on the BMI value, it categorizes the result into different health status categories like *Underweight*, *Normal weight*, *Overweight*, or *Obesity*.
